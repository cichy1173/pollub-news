# Pollub-news

It is ready to use OPML file that You can import with any RSS reader app. It contains sources related to Lublin University of Technology (Politechnika Lubelska) and Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

LUT official websites does not support RSS, so I generated them, and also I added some Facebook fan pages that publish news.

**RSS is generated with [FetchRSS app](www.fetchrss.com)**. Maybe in future I will replace it with something else.

This OPML file should work with almost all RSS readers that support OPML importing. I already tested this with:

- NextCloud News

- [NewsFlash](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.gitlab.newsflash) on Linux
